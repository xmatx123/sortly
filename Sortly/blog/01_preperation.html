            <h1>Preparations been stressful, but is it all worth it?</h1>
            <p>Its been in 2022, in the middle of the Summer in Berlin, in a Spa where the idea came up. Why not finish our Masters and start travelling the world?</p>
            <p>I was working full time at the DKB doing Product stuff for the new Banking and decided to do my MBA in IT Architecture while Jana did her Masters in Non-Profit Management while working as a working student at the same company in the CoBranding department. She held her end of the bargain and finished her Masters before the trip while I.. while I decided to take some homework on the trip.</p>
            <p>In the last couple of weeks we did a lot. Moving out, getting all the documents right, planning our farewell, visiting all of our families, getting the injections we need for the trip. In the meantime Jana also nailed her degree while I packed up at work. </p>
            <p>Now we are currently in the plane to JFK eager to see if everything was worth it. We are certain it will be.</p>
